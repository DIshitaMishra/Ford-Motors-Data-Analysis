# Ford-Motors-Data-Analysis
Exploratory Data Analysis using Pandas, seaborn, matplotlib

Project Overview:
==================
This data analysis project focuses on conducting a comprehensive analysis of Ford Motors' sales and pricing data. 
The project aims to extract meaningful insights, uncover trends, and provide recommendations for Ford based on the analysis of a dataset containing information about various Ford car models.
The dataset includes attributes such as model, year, price, transmission, mileage, fuel type, tax, mpg, and engine size.

Project Goals:
===============
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): The project begins with exploratory data analysis to understand the dataset's structure, identify missing or inconsistent data, and gain insights into the distribution of variables.

Data Cleaning: Data cleaning is performed to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies in the dataset, ensuring data quality and reliability for subsequent analysis.

Data Visualization: Utilizing data visualization techniques, the project visualizes key patterns, trends, and relationships in the data. Visualizations include scatter plots, line plots, bar plots, box plots, and heatmaps.

Correlation Analysis: The project investigates correlations between attributes, such as price, mileage, and engine size, to determine which factors most influence the pricing of Ford cars.

Market Analysis: The project analyzes the popularity of Ford car models based on sales, pricing, and year, providing insights into customer preferences and market dynamics.

Fuel Type Trends: The project explores trends in fuel type preferences for Ford cars over time, offering insights into changing customer preferences.

Demand Analysis: The project assesses how the demand for Ford cars has changed over the years, enabling Ford to adapt to evolving market conditions.

Tax Analysis: The project investigates the variation in tax based on engine size and fuel type, informing pricing and market strategies.

Project Outputs:
=================
The project results in a set of conclusions and recommendations for Ford Motors, informed by the data analysis:

Pricing strategies based on correlations with mileage and engine size.
